welcome to my profile, here you can see all my code. If you are browsing I can really recommend browsing some of my organistations since I have alot of my repo's stored there.

If you don't have the time for that. Hello I am Constantijn I am based in Holland(or somewhere with mountains). I am a software developer/anthropologist.
I enjoy working towards a world with better software; I do this together with clients and colleagues to identify opportunities and improve what's there. I also do this, if necessary, when I have to use PUSH RSP.
